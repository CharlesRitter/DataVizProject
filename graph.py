    #happen on each day of the week

    #separate the x-axis data (the days of the week) from the
    #'counter' variable form the y-axis data (the number of)
    #incidents for each day)

    #with that y-axis data, assign it to a matplotlib instance

    #create the amount of ticks needed fo rour x-axis, and assign
    #the labels

    #save the plot!

    #close the plot
